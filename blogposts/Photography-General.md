Looking at old photos always brings a smile to our faces and takes us back to that moment. 😇

#### Photography is an invisible time travel allowing us to relive the moments and emotions

Anyone can take photos, but only those passionate about it can replicate the exact scenario.

To become a good photographer, you need to master three basic rules which is composition, light and subject. Once you do that, you can capture the scene behind the lens.
