> Sometimes it's better to leave things as they are.

- At a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That's the world's greatest lie.

- The secret of happiness is to see all the Marvels of the world, never to forget the droid of oil on the spoon.

> All things are one.

- Iâ€™m beginning what I could have started 10 years ago. But Iâ€™m happy that I didnâ€™t wait 20 years.

> I can change those things that I don't want to happen.

> Life attracts Life.

- When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.

- you must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his destiny. If he abandons that pursuit, it's because it wasn't true loveâ€¦ the love that speaks the Language of the World.

- One is Loved because One is Loved. No reason is needed for loving.

- Don't think about what you have left behind.

- There is only one way to learn, it's through action.

- Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself.

- Everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him.

> Every search begins with beginnerâ€™s luck. And every search ends with the victorâ€™s being severely tested.

> The darkest hours of the night came just before dawn.

- Donâ€™t give in to your fears, if you do you won't be able to talk to your heart.

> There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.

- When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.

- Everything that happens once can never happen again. But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time.
