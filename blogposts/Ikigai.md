> Ikigai - the happiness of always being busy.

- Only staying active will make you want to live 100 years.

- Our Ikigai is the reason we get up in the morning.

- Have a purpose in life that is so important that you don't feel like retiring.

**_Hara Hachu bu_** - Fill your belly to 80%.

**_Mens sana in corpore sano_** - a sound mind only a sound body.

- He who has a why to live for can bear with almost anyhow.

**_Logotherapy_** - discovering one's purpose in life.

**_Morita therapy_** -

- accept your feelings
- do what you should be doing

Discover your life's purpose

If we try to get rid of 1 wave with another we end up with an infinite sea.

Find flow in everything you do.

Flow -

- Choose a difficult task (not too difficult)
- Have a clear, concrete objective
- Concentrate on a single task

> Fall seven times, rise eight.

> It's not what happens to you, but how you react that matters.
