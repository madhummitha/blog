Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform initially developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). At its core, Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. ðŸŽ¢

It provides native support for microservices architectures, container-based deployments, and modern DevOps practices, making it an ideal platform for building and running cloud-native applications. ðŸ“¦

Kubernetes monitors the health of applications and automatically restarts or reschedules containers that fail. ðŸ”ƒ
