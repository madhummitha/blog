#### It's always better to be recognized as THE WOMEN BEHIND THE LENS than the WOMEN IN THE LENS.

Missing the moments? Take a look at the captured snaps! 📷

The only way by which any of your hatred can be turned into love. ❤️

Photography is something that comes out of passion and love.
Capturing the moments helps to cherish the old times.
Looking at old photos always brings a smile to our faces and takes us back to that moment. 😇

#### Photography is an invisible time travel allowing us to relive the moments and emotions

Anyone can take photos, but only those passionate about it can replicate the exact scenario.

As you delve deeper into photography, your perspective and way of seeing things will inevitably change. 🤩

It allows you to travel to many different places and capture unique and memorable moments. 🗺️

Just like babies, cameras require gentle and careful handling to produce good results. 👼
